# pico-smart_enclosure
### Automatic active temperature control and lighting for a 3d printer enclosure.
Uses a raspberry Pi Pico connected to the printer via I2C to provide **automatic** active temperature control and full control of other enclosure functions via gcode (M260). 
Also gives full control via an OLed screen UI.

## Features
- **Automatic active temperature control**
- **Direct communication with the printer** (via I2C)
- **Smooth PWM lighting control**
- **Power loss recovery** (will save setting changes and state on power loss)
- **UI via OLed**
- Print name display while printing
- Fan kickstarting
- PWM fan speed control
- Printer-controllable max fan speed
- Motorized fan flap control
- Print done notification (light turns on)
- Use of the standby capabilities on ATX PSUs to save power
- Uses both cores in the pico for smoother real-time operation
- Highly customizable
- Light turns on when the door opens (if setting enabled)
- Control via:
    - UI - full control (except for print name), plus settings
    - M260 gcode commands (printer) - full control
    - USB connected computer - partial control (all but print name)
    - Two quick-acess buttons - changing light state and setting mode to cooldown only
- **Safety** features:
    - Fans and heaters turn off when door open
    - Sensor connection status is regularly checked
    - Sensor data is checked for plausibility (is it way to low, etc.)
    - Temperature exceeding set thresholds will cause shutdown (see below)
    - Will enter a safe "error" state if anything is wrong (invalid printer command, sensor disconnected, temp exceeds set bounds, etc.)
        - Turns off heaters
        - Turns off fans
        - Turns off lights
        - Turns off the power supply
        - Stops communication with printer
        - Sends data about the error via USB every 30 seconds, indefinitely

## To use
- **If you don't need to change anything in the code (if your hardware is the same as mine):**
	- Double check your wiring
        - Couldn't hurt, for what mine looks like see the wiring diagram below
        - Your switches can be either `NO` or `NC`, the code will detect this
    - **Ensure that whenever you upload a new version, the door is open (no switches are pressed)**
	- Plug the Raspberry Pi Pico into your computer while holding down the BOOTSEL button, copy [the latest .uf2 file](https://github.com/me25542/pico-smart_enclosure/releases) to the pico
	- Enjoy!
- **If you want to customize things in the code:**
	- I recommend Using Arduino IDE, as that is what I used and I know it works
	- Install [this](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico) board in Arduino IDE
	    - The link has good instructions, just scroll down a bit
	- Install all dependencies (see documentation)
	- Download the files in "src/Printer_enclosure_firmware" and open them in Arduino IDE
	- Change any values as needed, depending on your setup
	- Double check your wiring (couldn't hurt, for what mine looks like see the wiring diagram below)
	- Upload the code to your Pico (see above)
	- Enjoy!

## Printer compatibility
**This design is compatible with any printer that supports [M260](https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M260:_i2c_Send_Data) gcode commands and has an I2C bus that you can connect to.**

The only printers that I am *certain* will work with this are the Original Prusa MK4-series printers (I made this for my MK4), as their Xbuddy board has an I2C connector that is unused. (a female 4-pin Molex Click-Mate if you want to buy a cable to fit)

**Known compatible printers:**
- Prusa MK4(s)
- Prusa MK3.9(s)
- Prusa MK3.5(s)

However, many other printers *might* have I2C connectors, so it's worth checking yours. If you find other printers that are compatible, please let me know!

A raspberry Pi might also work (they have I2C) if you are using one for Octoprint or Klipper already, with a bit of modification.

## Contribution
If you want to contribute in any way, feel free to do so!

Whether it's reporting bugs or writing code, your contributions will be helpful.

### Ideas for features to add
- Thermal runaway protection
    - protect heaters from thermal runaway
- Audible notification for print done
    - Play a small chime or sound when the print is set to done
- Support for basic control through printer GPIO pins (for printers without I2C)
    - Have a small number of pins be able to, say, set the temperature to one of two states
    - Cut out any unneeded functionality (like setting the lights, fine temperature control, etc.)
- Anything else you can think of!
    - If you can, implement it!
    - If you can't, raise an issue requesting the feature

Thank you for any and all contributions!

**OK, I saved the story for the end ðŸ˜‰.**

I couldn't find code for a smart printer enclosure that had all the features I wanted. 
Mainly, I wanted something that was automatic; I didn't want to have to set fans, heaters, etc. *every single print**. 
So, I spent a lot of time making this. 
I believe it is the most fully featured codebase for a 3d printer enclosure you could find, mainly because I couldn't find a more fully featured one.
