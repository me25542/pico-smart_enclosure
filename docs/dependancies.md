## This program has several dependencies you will need to install if you want to compile it yourself:

**Mainly, you will need to install the [earlephilhower / Arduino-pico core](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico).** This provides both the ability to compile code for the Pico, and several dependencies like:
  - stdlib
  - Wire
  - Servo
  - EEPROM
  - mutex
