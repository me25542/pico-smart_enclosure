## BOM

(In no particular order):
- 1x 3d printer enclosure
- 1x ATX power supply (anything powerful enough for your heater will work)
- 1x Raspberry Pi Pico
- 1x ssd1306-based OLed display with I2C support (the UI is optimized for the ones with a rectangle of yellow pixels at the top)
- 1x 12v heater
- 1x 5v relay module (at least one channel)
- 1x 220Ω resistor
- 1x 5mm LED
- 2x generic logic level converters (the "bad" kind)
- 2x 5v 9g servos
- 3x MCP9808 sensors
- 3x micro switches
- 3x push-button switches
- 4x BC337 transistors
- 4x 1kΩ resistors
- Some 12v white LED strips
- Some sort of connector to plug into your printer's control board (4 pin Molex Click-Mate for a MK4)
- Probably some other little things that I forgot. Use common sense.
