(In no particular order):
- 1x 3d printer enclosure
- 1x ATX power supply (anything over ~250w will work)
- 1x Raspberry Pi Pico
- 1x heater
	- 2x 50w 3Ω power resistors
	- 1x old computer heatsink w. 12v fan
- 1x 5v relay module (at least one channel)
- 2x generic logic level converters (the "bad" kind)
- 2x 5v 9g servos
- 3x MCP9808 sensors
- 3x micro switches
- 4x BC337 transistors
- 4x 1kΩ resistors
- 4x 220Ω
- 4x white 5mm LEDs
- Some 12v white LED strips
- Some sort of connector to plug into your printer's control board (Molex Click-Mate for a MK4)
- Probably some other little things that I forgot. Use common sense.
