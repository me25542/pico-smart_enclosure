## You will probably want to print some parts for your enclosure

### Some things you might want to print include:
- PSU holder
- Indicator light holder
- Switch (button) holders
- Relay board holder
- Heater mount

I plan to include the files for what I used for some of these, but others might also work.

[This](https://www.printables.com/@_me_/collections/1713789) is an up-to-date list of the printed parts I used for my enclosure
